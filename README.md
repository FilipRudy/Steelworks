## Description

Steelworks is a landing page created for one of the biggest steel processing companies based in the Silesian Voivodeship in Poland. After they reached out to me, I identified their needs and decided that a simple project utilizing React + AWS Lambda functionality would suffice, as there was no real need to create any backend functionalities. One of the key features of this project is that the page is also localized in four languages in total.

```
git clone https://github.com/FilipRudy/Steelworks.git
